## Calibration, Validation, and Simulation of TKTD models in R

The [*cvasi*](https://github.com/cvasi-tktd/cvasi) package aims to ease the use of ecotox effect models by providing an intuitive workflow. Model inputs and parameters are encapsulated in scenario objects which can be piped to other functions. Operations can be chained using the *tidyr* syntax. The most time-consuming processes can be run in parallel if requested. The [*cvasi.ui*](https://github.com/cvasi-tktd/cvasi.ui) package provides a user-friendly graphical interface for features of the *cvasi* package.
