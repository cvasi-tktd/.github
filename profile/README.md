## Calibration, Validation, and Simulation of TKTD models in R

The cvasi package aims to ease the use of ecotox effect models by providing an intuitive workflow. Model inputs and parameters are encapsulated in scenario objects which can be piped to other functions. Operations can be chained using the tidyr syntax. The most time-consuming processes can be run in parallel if requested.
